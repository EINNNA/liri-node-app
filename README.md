Liri Node App 
Siri's little sister. 

How to use: 

    type "node liri (a) (b)" in terminal

(a) = 
    concert-this // to search for concerts
    movie-this // to search for movies 
    spotify-this-song // to search for songs on Spotify
    do-what-it-says // to search up something random. 
  
(b) =
    any artist, movie, or song that you like
    
Problems 
    As this uses an API from various websites to search, some things may not return data. If that is the case, please search up another song, movie, or artist.
